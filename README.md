# Cyber Security Tools
## Password
This is where everything password-related will be located from brute force attacks to just normal file attacks there is windows related stuff and normal password stuff in there.
## Spying
This is where you can spy on a target by watching their every move, You will see keyloggers and maybe internet-related stuff.
## Deploying
This is where you deploy your viruses or spyware into the computer
## Backdoor
This is where you can put a file into a host machine and be able to access it from wherever you are. *(These will require things like port forwarding, etc.)*

# Recommendations
1. If you don't want the shell open on the victim's screen rename the file extension from **.py** to **.pyw** *(This hides the terminal)*
2. If you are gonna be running this on a machine that **doesn't** have Python installed make sure to use something like <a href="https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/">*Pyinstaller*</a> so it is only an exe when you run it on the other machine.
3. For some of these you will want it to be running 24/7 so you need to make it a startup file using c.cmd or something like that.
