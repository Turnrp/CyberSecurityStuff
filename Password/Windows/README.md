# WINDOWS PASSWORD HASHING

## Instructions
1. Run the script *(You will be prompted for admin privileges this is so it can access registry)*
2. Copy the files to a flash drive or somewhere safe
3. Parse the Sam and System saves to get the hashes
4. Then run my <a href="https://github.com/Turnrp/CyberSecurityStuff/blob/main/Password/HashKiller.py">HashKiller.py</a> file using a list or a brute force attack.
5. *If you do not have a word list and don't wanna wait 10 years for the brute force* you can try <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials">Daniel Miessler's Common Credentials Word Lists</a> and check if their password is in one of those and if not you can do a brute force attack
