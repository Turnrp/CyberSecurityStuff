# Backdoors
## Basic Backdoor
### Commands
- download <FILE> *(This downloads files from the server)*
- upload <FILE> *(This uploads a file on **your** machine)*
- dir *(This lists every file & directory in the servers curDir)*
- get <size> <FILE> *(If the file exists on your machine it will tell you the size of that file otherwise if its on the server's machine it will tell you the size of their file -> bytes)*
- set <bytes> <AMOUNT> *(Sets the chosen amount of bytes to send back and forth)*
- print <FILE> *(Since the cmd line is weird I had to add this)*
- <ANY> *(It will run the command in a new window.)*
### WARNINGS
- If you run a file that loops the server may crash and not run so be careful with what you run
- This is my first backdoor script so if you have any recommendations please tell me using **Issues** or something like that.
