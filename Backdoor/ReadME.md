# Backdoors
## Basic Backdoor
### Commands
- download <FILE> *(This downloads files from the server)*
- upload <FILE> *(This uploads a file on **your** machine)*
- dir *(This lists every file & directory in the servers curDir)*
- get <size> <FILE> *(If the file exists on your machine it will tell you the size of that file otherwise if its on the server's machine it will tell you the size of their file -> bytes)*
- set <bytes> <AMOUNT> *(Sets the chosen amount of bytes to send back and forth)*
- print <FILE> *(Since the cmd line is weird I had to add this)*
- <ANY> *(It will run the command in a new window.)*
### WARNINGS
